# Amazon-Data-Analysis-Projects-Portfolio
This repository contains my data analysis projects where I have performed data analysis tasks such as data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.
I performed data analysis of Amazon Prime Titles data to explore some of the insights that can be taken away. This public dataset is taken from Kaggle.
